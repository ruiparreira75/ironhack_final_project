## Dataset Selection 

I used Steamspy API dataset for the project. The dataset lists 1000 most popular games from steam. 
It contains 1000 rows in 17 initial columns. The API refreshes data every 24 hours. 

https://steamspy.com/api.php?request=all

The dataset contains names of the games, developer/publisher names, positive/negative user reviews, onwers, average and median playtime, price and peak concurrent users.
